## üë∂ Getting Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `moerphous` for local development.

1. Fork the `moerphous` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/moerphous.git
```

3. Navigate to the recently created directory:

```sh
cd moerphous
```

4. Install the main dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

5. Create a branch for local development:

```sh
git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

6. Set the following env variable for redux debugging purposes:

```sh
export REACT_APP_STAGE="dev"
```

This will allow you to inspect every state and action payload.

7. Set the following env variable:

```sh
export REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
```

Now you can make your changes locally.

8. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

9. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
